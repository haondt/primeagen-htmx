Following along ThePrimeagen's HTMX golang course - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7v6SNIgJpE

I used python and hyperscript in place of golang and javascript, respectively.

## Running

Set up dependencies with
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run with

```bash
python3 server.py
```
